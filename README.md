# Project : CSS-Normandie


## To-do
<br/>
✔️
⌛ Template page design w/ JS<br/>
❌ Design the page<br/>
❌ Create the website content (HTML/CSS)<br/>
❌ Python webserver (FLASK)<br/>
❌ Send to moodle (easy format + project format)<br/>


## Q/A
__Q :__ Why expanding the original project ?<br/>
__A :__ I've been wanting to create a website since a while, and the best way to learn is to do projects. Web Developpement is a very wide domain that I want to be proficient in, so I wanna try many things before choosing preferences (frameworks, supersets, tech stacks)<br/>

__Q :__ Why Less ?<br/>
__A :__ One of the requierements is to do everything in ONE CSS file, so it's way easier to do multiple Less files, then compile them into a single CSS. Nice sneaky work around.<br/>
