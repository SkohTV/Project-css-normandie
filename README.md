## Q/A
__Q :__ Why expanding the original project ?<br/>
__A :__ I've been wanting to create a website since a while, and the best way to learn is to do projects. Web Developpement is a very wide domain that I want to be proficient in, so I wanna try many things before choosing preferences (frameworks, supersets, tech stacks).<br/>

__Q :__ Why Less instead of classic CSS ?<br/>
__A :__ One of the requierements is to do everything in ONE CSS file, so it's way easier to do multiple Less files, then compile them into a single CSS. Nice sneaky workaround. Also, Lesss is a superset of CSS unlike SASS, so it's easier for converting multiple Less to one (good looking) CSS file (unlike SASS, which would require more work).<br/>

__Q :__ There's not a lot of JS, isn't it ?<br/>
__A :__ Yes, I've never touched it before so I'm not really able to create my own. I had planned to learn the basics to customize / optimize it, but I think time's gonna be too short.<br/>

__Q :__ There are 2 different versions ?<br/>
__A :__ The requierements were vague enough to allow me to do this project, but because I don't wanna risk getting minus points on my grade I made a "requierements only version", where all Flask, Less and all have been removed, to just keep the essentials.<br/>

__Q :__ Is it just me, or is the website taking time to load ?<br/>
__A :__ Well, yes. I'm not very knowledgable in this field, but I think it concerns either Flask, Replit or the JS (I'm like 95% sure it's replit's fault). And because all of them are pretty foreign to me, I don't wanna bother too much about what is causing this (heck, I'm not gonna write a whole Rust Backend).<br/>

__Q :__ What the hell is going on with units in Less/CSS ?<br/>
__A :__ One of my goals was to create an almost fully responsive website, and one of the best way I found to do it was viewport and percent units. Whose mixed with calc function can lead to some wonders. I also added some media queries because website template was looking weird on phone (and because that might be an evaluation criteria).<br/>

__Q :__ Do you plan on maintaining the replit webserver and/or patching bugs afterward ?<br/>
__A :__ Lmao no.<br/>
