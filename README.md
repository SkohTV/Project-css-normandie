## Q/A
__Q :__ Why expanding the original project ?<br/>
__A :__ I've been wanting to create a website since a while, and the best way to learn is to do projects. Web Developpement is a very wide domain that I want to be proficient in, so I wanna try many things before choosing preferences (frameworks, supersets, tech stacks)<br/>

__Q :__ Why Less instead of classic CSS ?<br/>
__A :__ One of the requierements is to do everything in ONE CSS file, so it's way easier to do multiple Less files, then compile them into a single CSS. Nice sneaky work around.<br/>

__Q :__ There's not a lot of JS, right ?<br/>
__A :__ Yes, I've never touched it before so I'm not really able to create my own. I had planned to learn the basics to customize / optimize it, but I think time's gonna be too short.<br/>

__Q :__ There are 2 different versions ?<br/>
__A :__ The requierements were vague enough to allow me to do this project, but because I don't wanna risk getting minus points on my grade I made a "requierements only version", where all Flask, Less and the rest have been removed, to just keep the essentials.<br/>

__Q :__ Is it just me, or is the website taking time to load ?<br/>
__A :__ Well, yes. I'm not very knowledgable in this field, but I think it concerns either Flask, Replit or the JS. And because all of them are pretty foreign to me, I don't wanna bother too much about what is causing this (heck, I'm not gonna write a whole Rust Backend).<br/>

__Q :__ How was the website designed ?<br/>
__A :__ This project was my first experience with Figma, if you wanna take a look to the original design, [click here](www.figma.com/file/0cB3RNgtH0aoNngx5zdrXc)<br/>


## Project

### Goal
Small project to apply bases in HTML/CSS. The goal has been greatly expanded to get used to JS, Less, FLASK and the architecture of a website.

### Requirement
Thoses are the requierements for the project :<br/>
\- No CSS frameworks<br/>
\- At least one flex css and one grid<br/>
\- Have responsive design<br/>
\- Images sizes must fit requierements<br/>
\- Only one CSS file<br/>

### Access

▶️ The server is also hosted at all time on https://project-css-normandie.skohtv.repl.co/ for free by replit.it<br/>
